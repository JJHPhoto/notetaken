## How to use app

### Workflow

To start with this homework assignment, I looked at an activity we had done in this unit that had very similar properties. I set up my server and port listener then tested that it was working. It worked fine. I then worked on getting my GET & POST paths working. I was a bit confused by this at first. However, working with my study group and my tutor gave me enough understanding to start connecting dots.

Before I got too far along the project, I wanted to try and make my server code more modular. So, I began by making files for each of my routes.
